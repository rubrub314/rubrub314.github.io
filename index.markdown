Hello! My name is Rushil Shah, and I have had a passion for STEM for as long as I can remember. Through countless competitions, research, and teaching, I have explored this passion, and I hope to continue to do so as I journey to college. This website acts a place where I can showcase some of the projects I have been part of, deliver handouts that can be used to explore STEM, and provide one on one tutoring for those interested in studying for competitions or just trying to get ahead in school. A list of qualifications and experience can be found here if you are interested in signing up for tutoring.
