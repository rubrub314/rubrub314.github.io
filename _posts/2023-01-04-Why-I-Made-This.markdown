Hello! This website took ages to make. I started on January 1st because I have been wanting to make a website where I can put all of my projects and things, and I guess the "New Year's Resolution" provided me motivation to actually make this.
<br> <br>
I started off by figuring how to use git which took some time but wasn't too bad. The annoying part was trying to get jekyll and implement it with github pages. I downloaded jekyll properly, and it worked locally, but when I tried to push the changes onto github, nothing was working. So, that led to searching stack exchange for like ages lol, but as you can see, I finally got it to work.
<br> <br>
I then installed the midnight theme from GitHub Pages which also took forever because all these random errors kept occuring, but thanks to this one random website, I found out the cause of failure. Now, I have added a few things to the site.
<br> <br>
Over the next few weeks, I intend to make the website look nicer, add handouts, and figure out some paid tutoring logistics. But, I am really happy with what I have been able to produce. It should not have take 16 hours over the span of four days, but I am pretty proud of myself because I tried to make one last year and that flopped terribly.
<br> <br>
Anyways, thanks so much for visiting this site! I hope you find it somewhat useful and that it inspires you to make your own website.
